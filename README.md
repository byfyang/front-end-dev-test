# front-end-dev-test

## Intro


### *Please also submit a small write up discussing (leave answers to a sentence or two):*

  1. What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap) ? 
  Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap
   I used primarily these for simplicity and easiness. They are very widely used and people understand it. Since the content on this site is static, I didn't feel it was necessary to add more levels of complexities such as a front end framework like React or Angular. 

  2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose?
  I had trouble using webpack and surge. This was my first time using Surge as a host and I was unfamiliar with how it interacted with webpack. 

  3. What you enjoyed the most and why?
  I enjoy the process of making and the eventual product.
